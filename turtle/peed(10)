Help on function speed in module turtle:

ssppeeeedd(speed=None)
    Return or set the turtle's speed.

    Optional argument:
    speed -- an integer in the range 0..10 or a speedstring (see below)

    Set the turtle's speed to an integer value in the range 0 .. 10.
    If no argument is given: return current speed.

    If input is a number greater than 10 or smaller than 0.5,
    speed is set to 0.
    Speedstrings  are mapped to speedvalues in the following way:
        'fastest' :  0
        'fast'    :  10
        'normal'  :  6
        'slow'    :  3
        'slowest' :  1
    speeds from 1 to 10 enforce increasingly faster animation of
    line drawing and turtle turning.

    Attention:
    speed = 0 : *no* animation takes place. forward/back makes turtle jump
    and likewise left/right make the turtle turn instantly.

    Example:
    >>> speed(3)
